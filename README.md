# 🎵 RiwiMusic Console Application

RiwiMusic is a **C# console-based music event management system** that allows users to manage concerts, register clients, sell tickets, and perform advanced queries using **LINQ**.

This project applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles to organize code logically and model real-world entities like concerts, clients, and tickets.

# 🖥️ Usage Flow

When you run the program, you’ll see a main menu with options:  

- Manage Concerts 🎤  
- Manage Clients 👤  
- Manage Tickets 🎟️  
- Purchase History 📜  
- Advanced Queries 🔍  

Follow the menu prompts to navigate through different modules.  

### Example workflow:
- Add a new concert  
- Register a client  
- Sell a ticket for the client to attend the concert  
- View purchase history and run LINQ queries

# 🧑‍💻 OOP Justification in RiwiMusic

For the RiwiMusic project, we applied **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** to structure the code in a more logical and real-world manner.  

### Identifying Entities as Classes
- Main entities: **Concert**, **Client**, and **Ticket**.  
- Each class acts as a blueprint grouping attributes and behaviors.  
- The **Ticket** class is crucial because it links a **Client** with a **Concert** via their IDs.  

### Encapsulation
- A central class **RiwiMusicSystem** stores all data collections (concerts, clients, tickets) as **private lists**.  
- Only **public methods** (e.g., `RegisterClient()`) can modify them.  
- This ensures **security and organization**, hiding internal complexity.  

### Abstraction
- The **Program.cs** file remains clean and only calls methods from `RiwiMusicSystem`.  
- The internal business logic is abstracted away from the main entry point.  

### Future Extensibility (Polymorphism & Inheritance)
- While inheritance wasn’t necessary in this version, polymorphism could easily be applied in the future (e.g., different ticket types such as **VIP** or **General** with different rules).  

📌 **In summary:**  
OOP allowed us to divide the project into clear modules, making the system organized, secure, and collaborative-friendly.
